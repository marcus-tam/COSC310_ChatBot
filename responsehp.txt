You might belong in Hufflepuff,\nWhere they are just and loyal,\nThose patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;
Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\nif you've a ready mind,\nWhere those of wit and learning,\nWill always find their kind;
Or perhaps in Slytherin\nYou'll make your real friends,\nThose cunning folk use any means\nTo achieve their ends.
