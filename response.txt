...for people just waiting. \n Waiting for a train to go \n or a bus to come, or a plane to go \n or the mail to come, or the rain to go \n or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow \n or the waiting around for a Yes or No \n or waiting for their hair to grow. \n Everyone is just waiting.

CategoryLocation
Not in a box. Not with a fox. Not in a house. Not with a mouse. 
Not in the dark! Not in a tree!
Not in a car! 
At the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows and no birds ever sing excepting old crows ...

So that you and your heirs
May be properly billed.

To come to the aid of their country!"

CategoryPerseverance
I've got to protect them. I'm bigger than them.
You'll get mixed up, of course,
as you already know.
You'll get mixed up
with many strange birds as you go.
So be sure when you step.
Step with care and great tact
and remember that Life's
a Great Balancing Act.
Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.
And never mix up your right foot with your left.
