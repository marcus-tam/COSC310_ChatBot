Question
The1 5009 Hats9 of1 Bartholomew9 Cubbins9
CategoryBook
The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins is a children's book, written and illustrated by me and \n published by Vanguard Press in 1938. Unlike the majority of Geisel's books, it is written in prose rather than rhyming and metered \n verse. Geisel, who collected hats, got the idea for the story on a commuter train from New York to New England while he was sitting \n behind a businessman wearing a hat; the passenger was so stiff and formal that Geisel idly wondered what would happen if he took the \n man's hat and threw it out the window. Geisel concluded that the man was so "stuffy" that he would just grow a new one.(Source: Wiki)
